My name is Silvio Paganini and I write [code](https://github.com/silviopaganini).  
I like science, blockchain, astronomy, cosmology, maths, snowboard, food and travelling.  
One day I will disappear and be a travel blogger or a snowboarder (ok, maybe not).

Currently contracting for [AllOfUs](https://www.allofus.com), I'm also the Founder of [FLUUUID](https://fluuu.id) and CTO/Principal Developer of [Woala](https://woala.com), curator of [codedoodl.es](http://codedoodl.es/), part of TheFWA [Judging](https://www.thefwa.com/interview/silvio-paganini/) panel and moderator of [DevCon.London](http://devcon.london). Sometimes I write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@silviopaganini) and blog [inspirational](http://silviopaganini.tumblr.com/) art.

In the past 17 years, I've worked for Pigzbe.com, YOOX Net-a-Porter, Stinkdigital, Nexus Interactive Arts, Jam3, North Kingdom, UNIT9, Hi-ReS!, R/GA, Isobar Nowlab, Sapient Nitro, Blast Radius, Agency Republic, Bleed, GyroHSR, EURO RSCG, Publicis, JWT and Rapp Digital.
